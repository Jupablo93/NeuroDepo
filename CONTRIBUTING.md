# Contributing to NeuroSites

Thanks for helping grow **NeuroSites**!  
This repository is designed to be a community-driven collection of templates for neuroscience-related websites.

To keep everything organized, **please follow these contribution guidelines**:

---

## Folder Structure

Each template must follow this structure:

template-name/
├── README.md # Brief description + screenshot + usage instructions
├── index.html # Main page
├── style.css # Styling
├── script.js # Optional interactivity (can be blank)
└── assets/
└── images/ # Placeholder images or screenshots (e.g., preview.png)

---

## Naming Conventions

- Use **lowercase-hyphenated** folder names (e.g., `lab-website-minimal`, `event-promo-colorful`)
- Avoid spaces or special characters

---

## README in Each Template

Every template must include a `README.md` with:

- Template name and short description
- Screenshot or preview image (place in `assets/images`)
- Features (e.g., “Responsive layout”, “Multi-section design”)
- Usage instructions (how to customize)

---

## How to Add a Template

1. **Fork** this repository
2. **Create a new folder** in the root directory with your template name
3. Add the required files (`index.html`, `style.css`, etc.)
4. Add a **README.md** and at least one **screenshot** (`assets/images/preview.png`)
5. Update the root `index.html` (template directory page) to link to your new template
6. Submit a **pull request**

---

## Style Guidelines

- Keep code **lightweight and beginner-friendly** (pure HTML/CSS/JS; avoid heavy frameworks unless needed)
- Use **placeholder text and images** (no personal info)
- Comment code where helpful
- Ensure **responsiveness** (mobile-friendly)

---

## Previewing Templates

- Locally: open `index.html` in a browser or run `python3 -m http.server`
- Online: once merged, templates will be viewable via GitHub Pages
